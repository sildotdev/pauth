# PAUTH

PAUTH is the authentication app for Palomino. It handles three authentication methods:

## Player Authentication
Garry's Mod cleints are sent a challenge code generated by an authenticated gameserver after selecting a character. Game clients send this code to PAUTH and receive a JWT token. From then on, they can make requests to [PAPI](https://github.com/sildotdev/papi). All of this is done in the background, without player input.

## Server Authentication
Game Servers authenticate using a private key, and receive a JWT token for use with PAUTH. They can then use this code to make requests to [PAPI](https://github.com/sildotdev/papi).

## Webclient Authentication
This is the most straightforward authentication method. We use the Passport library to have the users login through Steam. Then, we fetch the corresponding SteamID's characters from the MySQL database and have them select one.
